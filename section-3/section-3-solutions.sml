(** Higher-Order Fun **)

(* There Can Be Only One *)

fun fold_map f = List.foldr (fn (x, acc) => f x :: acc) []

fun fold_filter p = List.foldr (fn (x, acc) => if p x then x :: acc else acc) []

(* The Evil Twin *)
fun unfold f state =
    case f state of
        NONE => []
      | SOME (state', x) => x :: unfold f state'

(* A Novel Approach *)
val factorial = (List.foldl (op * ) 1) o (unfold (fn x => if x = 0 then NONE else SOME (x - 1, x)))

(* Answer to bonus question: No. Simple tail-recursive
   factorial works in constant space, while unfold here
   constructs a list of size n. In later sessions we
   will study a data structure that would make
   virtually the same implementation efficient. *)

(* Unforeseen Developments *)
fun unfold_map f =
    let
        fun helper param =
            case param of
                [] => NONE
              | x :: xs => SOME (xs, f x)
    in
        unfold helper
    end

(* So Imperative *)
fun do_until f p x =
    if p x
    then x
    else do_until f p (f x)

(* Yet Another Factorial *)
fun imp_factorial n = #1 (do_until (fn (acc, x) => (acc * x, x - 1)) (fn (_, x) => x = 0) (1, n))

(* Fixed Point *)
fun fixed_point f = do_until f (fn x => f x = x)

(* Newton's Method *)
fun my_sqrt n =
    let
        fun fixed_point f = do_until f (fn x => abs (f x - x) < 0.0001)
    in
        fixed_point (fn x => 0.5 * (x + n / x)) n
