# Practice Problems for Section 3

## Higher-Order Fun

### There Can Be Only One

Write functions `fold_map` and `fold_filter` that have the
same signatures and behavior as `List.map` and `List.filter`
correspondingly. Use `List.foldr`. Do not use pattern
matching or any other list functions.

**SIGNATURE:** `val fold_map = fn : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list`

**EXAMPLE:** `fold_map (fn x => x + 1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

**SIGNATURE:** `val fold_filter = fn : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list`

**EXAMPLE:** `fold_filter (fn x => x mod 2 = 0) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [2, 4]`

### The Evil Twin

Write a function `unfold` that takes a state transition
function and an initial state and produces a list. On each
step the current state is fed into the state transition
function, which evaluates either to `NONE`, indicating that
the result should contain no more elements, or to `SOME`
$$pair$$, where $$pair$$ contains the next state and the next
list element.

**SIGNATURE:** `val unfold = fn : ('a -> ('a * 'b) option) -> 'a -> 'b list`

**EXAMPLE:** `unfold (fn x => if x > 3 then NONE else SOME (x + 1, x)) 0 = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

### A Novel Approach

Write a function `factorial` that takes an integer number
$$n$$ and evaluates to $$n!$$. Your function should be
a composition of `unfold` and `List.foldl`. You should not
use any other list functions, recursion or pattern matching.

**BONUS QUESTION:** Is this function as good as a simple
tail-recursive factorial implementation?

**SIGNATURE:** `val factorial = fn : int -> int`

**EXAMPLE:** `factorial 4 = 24`

### Unforeseen Developments

Write a function `unfold_map`, that behaves exactly as
`List.map` and `fold_map`, but that would be implemented in
terms of `unfold`.

**SIGNATURE:** `val unfold_map = fn : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list`

**EXAMPLE:** `unfold_map (fn x => x + 1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

### So Imperative (*)

Write a function `do_until` that takes three arguments, `f`,
`p` and `x`, and keeps applying `f` to `x` until `p x`
evaluates to `true`. Upon reaching that condition,
`f (f (f ... (f x) ...))` is returned.

**SIGNATURE:** `val do_until = fn : ('a -> 'a) -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a -> 'a`

**EXAMPLE:** `do_until (fn x => x div 2) (fn x => x mod 2 <> 0) 48 = 3`

### Yet Another Factorial

Write a function `imp_factorial` that has the same behavior as
the `factorial` function described above, but is defined in
terms of `do_until`.

**NOTE:** There is a deep relationship between these two
versions of `factorial` function, with `imp_factorial`
eliminating the building of an intermediate list.

**SIGNATURE:** `val imp_factorial = fn : int -> int`

**EXAMPLE:** `imp_factorial 4 = 24`

### Fixed Point (*)

Write a function `fixed_point` that accepts some function `f`
and an initial value `x`, and keeps applying `f` to `x` until
an `x` is found such that `f x = x`. Note that the function
must have the same domain and codomain, and that the values
must be comparable for equality.

**SIGNATURE:** `val fixed_point = fn : (''a -> ''a) -> ''a -> ''a`

**EXAMPLE:** `fixed_point (fn x => x div 2) 17 = 0`

### Newton's Method

Square root of a real number $$n$$ is a fixed point of
function $$f_n(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x + \frac{n}{x})$$.
Unfortunately, for reasons rooted in the arcane art of
numerical analysis, `real`s are not comparable for equality in
Standard ML. Write a function `my_sqrt` that takes a real
number and evaluates to an approximation of its square root.
You will probably need to write a version of `fixed_point`
that uses "difference in absolute value less than
$$\epsilon$$" as a test for equality. Use
$$\epsilon = 0.0001$$. Use the number itself as an initial
guess.

**SIGNATURE:** `val my_sqrt = fn : real -> real`

**EXAMPLE:** `abs (my_sqrt 2.0 - Math.sqrt 2.0) < 0.01`

### Deeper Into The Woods

Let's reuse the binary tree data structure from practice
problems for Section 2:

    datatype 'a tree = leaf | node of { value : 'a, left : 'a tree, right : 'a tree }

Write functions `tree_fold` and `tree_unfold` that would
serve as equivalents of `fold` and `unfold` on lists for this
data structure.

**HINT:** This is a hard problem, but consider this: the
initial value for `fold` corresponds to the base case of
recursion on lists (i.e., matching `[]`), while the function
passed to the `fold` corresponds to the case when we match
on `::`. `[]` and `::` correspond to `leaf` and `node` data
constructors. Similar reasoning applies to `unfold`. You might
also want to meditate over the signatures below if this does
not provide sufficient insight.

**SIGNATURE:** `val tree_fold = fn : ('a * 'b * 'a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b tree -> 'a`

**EXAMPLE:** `tree_fold (fn (l, v, r) => l ^ v ^ r) "!" (node { value = "foo", left = node { value = "bar", left = leaf, right = leaf }, right = node { value = "baz", left = leaf, right = leaf }}) = "!bar!foo!baz!"`

**SIGNATURE:** `val tree_unfold = fn : ('a -> ('a * 'b * 'a) option) -> 'a -> 'b tree`

**EXAMPLE:** `tree_unfold (fn x => if x = 0 then NONE else SOME (x - 1, x, x - 1)) 2 = node { value = 2, left = node { value = 1, left = leaf, right = leaf }, right = node { value = 1, left = leaf, right = leaf }}`

## A Grand Challenge

Let's try to write a simple type inference algorithm for a
very simple expression language. We won't deal with functions,
variables or polymorphism.

The expressions will be represented by the following data
type:

    datatype expr = literal_bool | literal_int | binary_bool_op of expr * expr | binary_int_op of expr * expr | comparison of expr * expr | conditional of expr * expr * expr

The data constructors represent literal booleans, literal
integers, binary operators on booleans, binary operators on
integers, comparison operators and conditionals. Since we're
only interested in types, and not in actually evaluating our
expressions, we're omitting immaterial details, such as
whether a literal boolean is "true" or "false", or whether
an operator on integers is addition, subtraction or something
else entirely.

The types will be represented by the following simple
datatype:

    datatype expr_type = type_bool | type_int

The typing rules for our expression language are simple:

1. Literal booleans are of type `type_bool`.
2. Literal integers have type `type_int`.
3. Boolean operators have type `type_bool` provided that both
   of their operands also have type `type_bool`.
4. Integer operators have type `type_int` provided that both
   operands also have type `type_int`.
5. Comparison operators have type `type_bool` provided that
   both operands have type `type_int`.
6. Conditionals have the same type as the first branch,
   provided that the second branch has the same type, and the
   condition has type `type_bool`.

Write a function `infer_type` that accepts an `expr` and
evaluates to the type of the given expression. If the type
cannot be determined according to the rules above, raise
`TypeError` exception.

**SIGNATURE:** `val infer_type = fn : expr -> expr_type`

**EXAMPLE:** `infer_type (conditional (literal_bool, literal_int, binary_int_op (literal_int, literal_int))) = type_int`

## Back To The Future! 2

A few of the practice problems from Sections 1 and 2 can be
rewritten more elegantly using the material from Section 3.
All problem statements, **SIGNATURES** and **EXAMPLES** remain
the same. If there are any additional considerations, these
will be mentioned below. Only some of the potentially eligible
problems are included -- naturally, you're welcome to rewrite
the rest on your own, using similar approaches.

Write a function `gcd_list` following the specification from
Section 1's **Greated Common Divisor -- Continued** problem.
Use folds. Use the following implementation of `gcd` as a
helper function:

    fun gcd (a : int, b : int) =
        if a = b
        then a
        else
            if a < b
            then gcd (a, b - a)
            else gcd (a - b, b)

### Element Of A List -- Final Redux

Write a function `any_divisible_by` following the
specification from Section 1's **Element Of A List** problem.
Use folds or other higher-order list functions. Use the

`tree_unfold`.

had nothing to do with *that* part of it.
